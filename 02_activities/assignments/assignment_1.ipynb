    "2. Finding the minimum and maximum values in the set also takes O(n) time in the worst case, as it may need to iterate through all elements.\n",
    "3. The loop that checks for missing numbers runs from the minimum to the maximum value, which could be up to O(m) iterations, where m is the range of numbers between the minimum and maximum. In the worst case, if the range is large compared to n, this could lead to O(m) time complexity.\n",
    "4. Checking membership in the set (i.e., `number not in nums_set`) is O(1) on average due to the properties of sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the time complexity can be expressed as O(n + m), where n is the number of elements in the input list and m is the range of numbers between the minimum and maximum values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space Complexity:\n",
    "1. The space complexity is primarily determined by the space used to store the set `nums_set`, which takes O(n) space.\n",
    "2. Additionally, the `missing_number` list can take up to O(m) space in the worst case if all numbers in the range are missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the overall space complexity is O(n + m), where n is the number of elements in the input list and m is the range of numbers between the minimum and maximum values."
