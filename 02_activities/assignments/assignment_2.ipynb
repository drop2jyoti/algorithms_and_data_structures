    "#### 1. Use of Optional in Type Hints\n",
    "You are using `Optional['TreeNode']` correctly, allowing for the possibility of `None`. However, be aware that while using string annotations (like `'TreeNode'`), it requires the `__future__` import in Python versions before 3.7. In your current setup, it's safe to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. The `is_leaf` method\n",
    "This method is well-defined and should work correctly. No issues here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. The `build_from_breadth_first_traversal` method\n",
    "This method looks good, but just as a suggestion for clarity:\n",
    "- The `ValueError` message can be more descriptive. For example, you might want to specify what kind of values were found if they are not integers or `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. The `bt_path` function\n",
    "The function is defined correctly, and the logic within appears sound. However, to enhance readability and performance:\n",
    "- You can use list comprehension for the `visit` function to reduce the number of explicit checks for `node.left` and `node.right`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Error Handling\n",
    "Currently, your code raises a `ValueError` for input validation, which is good. Ensure that your tests cover various edge cases, such as an empty list, a list with invalid types, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. General Code Optimization\n",
    "- You may want to use `deque` from the `collections` module for your `current_path` if you expect a significant depth in the binary tree to avoid potential performance penalties with list append/pop operations due to resizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Optimized Code using dequeus\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- We use a deque to handle our traversal. We start by adding the root node and its initial path to the deque.\n",
    "- We pop elements from the left (the front of the deque) for processing, checking if each node is a leaf.\n",
    "- If it's a leaf, we add the current path to the all_paths list.\n",
    "- If the node has children, we append them to the deque along with the updated path.\n",

    "Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Traversal:\n",
    "\n",
    "The function traverses each node in the binary tree exactly once. In the worst case, if the tree is a complete binary tree with n nodes, we will visit each node once, leading to a time complexity of O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Path Construction:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each node, we create a new path list that includes the current node's value. This involves copying the current path, which takes O(h) time, where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case (for unbalanced trees), h can be equal to n for a skewed tree.\n",
    "However, since each node will be processed once, and the height of the tree can be at most n in the worst case, the overall time complexity remains O(n).\n",
    "Thus, the overall time complexity for the function is O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Queue Storage:\n",
    "\n",
    "The space used by the deque can grow up to the maximum number of nodes at any level of the tree. In the worst case (for a complete binary tree), the maximum number of nodes in the queue can be O(n/2), which simplifies to O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Path Storage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each path stored in the queue could take at most O(h) space, where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case, this can also be as large as O(n) for a skewed tree.\n",
    "Combining these factors, the overall space complexity is dominated by the storage of nodes in the deque, leading to a total space complexity of O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "Time Complexity: O(n)\n",
    "Space Complexity: O(n)\n",
