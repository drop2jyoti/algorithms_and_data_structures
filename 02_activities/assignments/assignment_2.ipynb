    "## Code review comments -\n",
    "#### 1. Use of Optional in Type Hints\n",
    "You are using `Optional['TreeNode']` correctly, allowing for the possibility of `None`. However, be aware that while using string annotations (like `'TreeNode'`), it requires the `__future__` import in Python versions before 3.7. In your current setup, it's safe to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. The `is_leaf` method\n",
    "This method is well-defined and should work correctly. No issues here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. The `build_from_breadth_first_traversal` method\n",
    "This method looks good, but just as a suggestion for clarity:\n",
    "- The `ValueError` message can be more descriptive. For example, you might want to specify what kind of values were found if they are not integers or `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. The `bt_path` function\n",
    "The function is defined correctly, and the logic within appears sound. However, to enhance readability and performance:\n",
    "- You can use list comprehension for the `visit` function to reduce the number of explicit checks for `node.left` and `node.right`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Error Handling\n",
    "Currently, your code raises a `ValueError` for input validation, which is good. Ensure that your tests cover various edge cases, such as an empty list, a list with invalid types, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. General Code Optimization\n",
    "- You may want to use `deque` from the `collections` module for your `current_path` if you expect a significant depth in the binary tree to avoid potential performance penalties with list append/pop operations due to resizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Optimized Code using dequeus\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- We use a deque to handle our traversal. We start by adding the root node and its initial path to the deque.\n",
    "- We pop elements from the left (the front of the deque) for processing, checking if each node is a leaf.\n",
    "- If it's a leaf, we add the current path to the all_paths list.\n",
    "- If the node has children, we append them to the deque along with the updated path.\n",
    "- This approach maintains the efficiency of the traversal while utilizing the deque for better performance in terms of append and pop operations.\n"

    "During the assignment, I tackled the problem of finding missing numbers in a specified range using Python. I employed set operations to efficiently identify and collect missing integers between 0 and the maximum value in the given list. The solution utilized a set to store the numbers from the list and compared it against a full set of expected numbers to find missing elements. The benefit of using sets as opposed to a list has some advantage ie it has a highly optimized method for checking whether a specific element is contained in the set. This solution works for both sorted and unsorted list.\n",
